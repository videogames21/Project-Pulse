# **Use Cases**

***Use Case ID and Name***  
*Give each use case a unique integer sequence number identifier. State a concise name for the use case that indicates the value the use case would provide to some user. Begin with an action verb, followed by an object.*

***Author and Date Created***  
*Enter the name of the person who initially wrote this use case and the date it was written.*

***Primary and Secondary Actors***  
*An actor is a person or other entity external to the software system being specified who interacts with the system and performs use cases to accomplish tasks. Different actors often correspond to different user classes, or roles, identified from the customer community that will use the product. Name the primary actor that will be initiating this use case and any other secondary actors who will participate in completing execution of the use case.*

***Trigger***  
*Identify the business event, system event, or user action that initiates the use case. This trigger alerts the system that it should begin testing the preconditions for the use case so it can judge whether to proceed with execution.*

***Description***  
*Provide a brief description of the reason for and outcome of this use case, or a high-level description of the sequence of actions and the outcome of executing the use case.*

***Preconditions***  
*List any activities that must take place, or any conditions that must be true, before the use case can be started. The system must be able to test each precondition. Number each precondition. Example: PRE-1: User’s identity has been authenticated.*

***Postconditions***  
*Describe the state of the system at the successful conclusion of the use case execution. Label each postcondition in the form POST-X, where X is a sequence number. Example: POST-1: Price of item in the database has been updated with the new value.*

***Main Success Scenario/Normal Flow***  
*Provide a description of the user actions and corresponding system responses that will take place during execution of the use case under normal, expected conditions. This dialog sequence will ultimately lead to accomplishing the goal stated in the use case name and description. Show a numbered list of actions performed by the actor, alternating with responses provided by the system. The normal flow is numbered “X.0”, where “X” is the Use Case ID.*

***Extensions:***

* ***Alternative Flows***  
  *Document other successful usage scenarios that can take place within this use case. State the alternative flow, and describe any differences in the sequence of steps that take place. Number each alternative flow in the form “X.Y”, where “X” is the Use Case ID and Y is a sequence number for the alternative flow. For example, “5.3” would indicate the third alternative flow for use case number 5\. Indicate where each alternative flow would branch off from the normal flow, and if pertinent, where it would rejoin the normal flow.*

* ***Exceptions***  
  *Describe any anticipated error conditions that could occur during execution of the use case and how the system is to respond to those conditions. Number each alternative flow in the form “X.Y.EZ”, where “X” is the Use Case ID, Y indicates the normal (0) or alternative (\>0) flow during which this exception could take place, “E” indicates an exception, and “Z” is a sequence number for the exceptions. For example “5.0.E2” would indicate the second exception for the normal flow for use case number 5\. Indicate where in the normal (or an alternative) flow each exception could occur.*

***Priority***  
*Indicate the relative priority of implementing the functionality required to allow this use case to be executed. Use the same priority scheme as that used for the functional requirements.*

***Frequency of Use***  
*Estimate the number of times this use case will be performed per some appropriate unit of time. This gives an early indicator of throughput, concurrent usage loads, and transaction capacity.*

***Business Rules***  
*List any business rules that influence this use case. Don’t include the business rule text here, just its identifier so the reader can find it in another repository when needed.*

***Associated Information***  
*Identify any additional requirements, such as quality attributes, for the use case that may need to be addressed during design or implementation. Also list any associated functional requirements that aren’t a direct part of the use case flows but which a developer needs to know about. Describe what should happen if the use case execution fails for some unanticipated or systemic reason (e.g., loss of network connectivity, timeout). If the use case results in a durable state change in a database or the outside world, state whether the change is rolled back, completed correctly, partially completed with a known state, or left in an undetermined state as a result of the exception.*

***Assumptions***  
*List any assumptions that were made regarding this use case or how it might execute.*

Tim Smith gives the following scores based on the rubric: 10, 9, 10, 9, 10, 10\. So the total score given by Tim is 58\. Lily Fisher gives the following scores based on the rubric: 5, 5, 10, 10, 10, 10\. So the total score given by Tim is 50\. The grade that John Doe receives that week is (58 \+ 50\) / 2 \= 54\.

# **Business Rules** {#business-rules}

BR-1: Every senior design team must be assigned at least one instructor. It is common that there are two instructors in one team: one is a real TCU instructor, the other one is the client. An instructor can be assigned to multiple teams.  
BR-2: For the fall semester, the active weeks are usually from the 5th week to the 15th week. Winter holidays are inactive weeks. For the spring semester, the active weeks are from the 1st week to the 15th week. Students are only allowed to submit peer evaluations during active weeks. However, they can submit weekly activities outside active weeks.  
BR-3: Peer evaluation cannot be edited once completed. (TODO)  
BR-4: A student can only submit a peer evaluation for the previous week. A student has one week to complete a peer evaluation for the previous week. If a student fails to complete a peer evaluation, she cannot make it up.  
BR-5: For the peer evaluation, a student can only see her rubric criterion scores, public comments, and the overall grade.
